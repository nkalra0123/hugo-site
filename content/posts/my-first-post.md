hange the hero background
For any page or post you can add a featured image by including the local path in front matter (see content in the exampleSite/content/_readme.md file for examples): featured_image: '/images/gohugo-default-sample-hero-image.jpg'

If you would like to hide the header text on the featured image on a page, set omit_header_text to true. See exampleSite/content/contact.md for an example.

You don't need an image though. The default background color is black, but you can change the color, by changing the default color class in the config.toml file. Choose a background color from any on the Tachyons library site, and preface it with "bg-"

example: background_color_class = "bg-blue" or background_color_class = "bg-gray"
